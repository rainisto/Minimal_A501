{"name":"Minimal A501","tagline":"Amiga 512kB memory expansion. Minimal cost efficient design.","body":"### Minimal A501 for Amiga500\r\n\r\nI've decided to open source my design after building few batches of these. Two versions of gerbers are available, single and panelized version which fits 4 boards inside 10x10cm area (many china pcb houses offer cheap deals on custom panelized under 10x10cm boards). Should work on all A500/A500+ machines Rev.3->Rev.8\r\n\r\n### BOM\r\n\r\n* AS4LC1M16E5-65JC AS4C1M16E5-60JC AS4C1M16E5 SOJ-42 (<a href=https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33027099079.html>aliexpress</a>)<br>\r\n* 100nF cap<br>\r\n* 2x20pin female angle header<br>\r\n* 1x2 angle header<br>\r\n* 2.54mm jumper<br>\r\n\r\n### Cost estimation\r\n\r\nOrdering 10x4 boards with required parts from Ali or other cheap sources (16.7.2020 status) total was 62euro. So 62/40 would be 1.55euro per piece. But of course that doesn't include the cost of solder paste or flux, but even if you calculate them in it still will be under 2e.\r\n\r\nFor 5x1 (min order for most cheap pcb houses) price per board is of course somewhat higher due postage per piece is higher, but should still be around 5-6e.\r\n\r\nCost of time soldering and testing the boards are not included in estimation :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
